# Changelog

All notable changes to VritraAI will be documented in this file.

## [0.30.0] - 2024-12-18

### Added
- **Sudo command support** - Full sudo command execution with color preservation
- **Sudo command validation** - Checks if commands exist before execution
- **Sudo autocompletion** - 30+ common sudo commands available via tab completion
- **Sudo security warnings** - Detects and warns about dangerous sudo operations (rm -rf, dd, etc.)
- **Parent directory path support** - Added support for `..` standalone command and `../folder`, `../../folder`, etc.
- **Home directory expansion** - Added support for `~`, `~/Documents`, `~/script.py`
- **Directory navigation** - Automatic directory change when using `./folder` or `/path/to/folder`
- **Error recovery mode** - AI-powered error recovery for missing files and paths
- **Similar file suggestions** - Fuzzy matching suggestions when files/paths don't exist
- **Visual feedback** - Enhanced visual feedback for directory changes and script execution
- **Chain command blocking** - Blocks dangerous commands (sudo, bash, path commands) in chain commands
- **Path validation warnings** - Detects suspicious path traversal patterns (more than 3 `../`)

### Fixed
- **Sudo color output** - Sudo commands now preserve colors (ls colors, grep colors, etc.)
- **Sudo output capture** - Fixed sudo command output capture for `explain_last` functionality - now properly logs actual command output instead of generic messages
- **Dangerous command detection** - Fixed detection for `sudo rm -rf *` and similar dangerous patterns
- **Path handling** - Fixed `~` standalone command (now works without `/`) and `..` standalone command
- **File execution** - Fixed interactive script execution for `./test.py` and `./test.sh`
- **Python error recovery** - Fixed error recovery for `python xyz.py` when file doesn't exist

### Changed
- **Default model** - Changed default Gemini model from "gemini-2.0-flash" to "gemini-flash-latest" (gf4)
- **Sudo execution** - Sudo commands now run in bash shell with environment preservation
- **Command blocking** - Enhanced blocking of shell commands and dangerous operations

### Improved
- **Sudo handling** - Complete rewrite of sudo command handling with security features
- **Error messages** - More informative error messages with specific suggestions for different file types
- **Command validation** - Better validation before command execution (checks command existence and syntax)
- **Security** - Enhanced security checks for dangerous operations
- **File execution** - Restricted to only `.py` and `.sh` files with strict validation
- **Shell command blocking** - Blocked all shell commands except `bash` (with restrictions)
- **Bash command restrictions** - Only allows `bash script.sh`, blocks `bash` alone and in chain commands
- **VritraAI command blocking** - Prevents launching VritraAI inside VritraAI shell

## [0.29.5] - 2025-12-01

### Added
- **Safe mode command** - Introduced `safe_mode` command for enhanced security and command validation
- Smart interactive command detection with comprehensive pattern matching
- Enhanced error recovery system with AI-powered suggestions
- Traceback sanitization to improve AI error analysis accuracy
- Support for detecting interactive commands with flags (`-i`, `--interactive`, `-it`, `-ti`)
- Improved detection of "command not found" errors (exit code 127)
- Enhanced history command with timestamps, head/tail piping support, and duplicate prevention
- Comprehensive path expansion for ~ and environment variables across all file/directory commands
- Enhanced AI context system - all AI requests now include full system info, directory structure, and project details
- Improved command validation - detects and rejects invalid flags/arguments before launching interactive shell
- `expand_path()` helper function for consistent path expansion across all commands
- `build_comprehensive_context()` function for rich AI context with system and directory information

### Fixed
- **Interactive commands now work properly** - Fixed issue where interactive commands (vim, nano, python, node, docker exec -it, etc.) would get stuck without output
- **Error recovery for system commands** - System commands like `bash test.sh` (when file doesn't exist) now properly show recovery options menu
- **AI error analysis** - Traceback sanitization removes vritraai.py references so AI focuses on user's actual errors instead of shell wrapper code
- Improved terminal handling for interactive subprocess commands
- Better error message detection from stderr for "not found" type errors
- **History command display** - Now correctly counts and shows only commands (not timestamps as separate entries)
- **Path expansion issues** - Commands like `ls ~/.config-vritrasecz/vritraai/` now work correctly
- **History duplicate entries** - Fixed issue where commands were being saved twice with file locking and duplicate detection
- **Invalid flag/argument handling** - Now properly detects and rejects invalid flags and non-flag arguments
- **OS info detection** - Robust error handling for Termux/Android environments with fallback methods

### Changed
- Interactive command execution now uses simpler subprocess approach (matching testt.py implementation)
- Error recovery system now checks actual error messages from stderr, not just exit codes
- Enhanced interactive command detection to include more patterns (git commands, docker, kubectl, etc.)
- **Error recovery prompts** - AI now provides multiple fix command options (3-5 different approaches) instead of single suggestions
- **Traceback display** - Removed full traceback display, now shows only error type and message for cleaner output
- **AI response branding** - All AI output now shows "VritraAI:" instead of "AI:" for consistent branding
- **History recording** - Enhanced with file locking, duplicate detection, and proper timestamp pairing
- **History display** - Improved formatting with cleaner output, proper command counting, and timestamp display

### Improved
- **History command** - Now supports piping to head/tail commands (e.g., `history | head 5`)
- **Path detection** - All file/directory commands now automatically expand shell variables (~, $VAR)
- **AI context** - Comprehensive context building includes system info, Python version, shell, directory structure, and project type
- **OS info function** - Enhanced `get_os_info()` with robust error handling, fallback methods, and Termux/Android detection
- **Error recovery** - AI suggestions now include multiple fix approaches with step-by-step instructions

### Technical Details
- Updated `is_interactive_command()` function with comprehensive detection patterns
- Added `sanitize_traceback_for_ai()` function to filter out shell wrapper code from tracebacks
- Improved error handling in both `subprocess.run()` and `subprocess.Popen()` code paths
- Enhanced `build_smart_error_context()` to use sanitized tracebacks
- Added `record_command_to_history()` function with file locking and duplicate prevention
- Created `_get_history_commands()` helper function for reusable history parsing
- Added `history_command_with_pipe()` function for head/tail support
- Implemented `expand_path()` function for consistent path expansion
- Enhanced `build_comprehensive_context()` for rich AI context
- Improved `get_os_info()` with fallback methods and Termux/Android detection
- Updated `parse_flags()` to detect invalid flags and non-flag arguments
